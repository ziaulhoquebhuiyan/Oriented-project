# Airlines Reservation System

## 1. Project Title
**Airlines Reservation System**

## 2. Project Description
This Java-based project provides a console application that mimics an airline reservation system. It helps users book, view, and manage airline reservations. The goal is to solve problems related to manual bookings and inefficiency in record management by implementing core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. OOP allows modular, scalable, and reusable design.

## 3. Goals and Key Functionalities
### Goals:
- Simulate a real-world airline reservation system
- Provide separate functionalities for users and admins
- Practice applying OOP principles

### Key Functionalities:
- Admin can add, remove and view flights
- User can view flights, book tickets, and cancel reservations
- Reservation history management

## 4. Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** None (core Java)
- **Database:** In-memory (ArrayLists); can be upgraded to MySQL/File I/O

## 5. OOP Principles Used
- **Encapsulation:** All variables are private, using getters and setters
- **Inheritance:** Base class `Person`, subclasses like `Admin`, `User`
- **Polymorphism:** Method overloading (e.g., multiple constructors) and overriding
- **Abstraction:** Interfaces/abstract classes used for modular features

## 6. Project Phases & Timeline
- Phase 1: Design classes and structure (1 day)
- Phase 2: Implement booking and user module (2 days)
- Phase 3: Implement admin module (1 day)
- Phase 4: Testing and cleanup (1 day)

## 7. Final Product and Usefulness
This system helps digitize airline reservations efficiently and demonstrates the power of OOP in software design. Users benefit from easy-to-use booking, while developers understand system architecture.

## 8. Summary
The Airlines Reservation System project showcases how Java and OOP concepts can be applied in real-world software. It promotes better understanding, modular development, 
and user experience.
